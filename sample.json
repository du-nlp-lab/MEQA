        "context": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In March 2011, the Russian security service sent a stark warning to the F.B.I., reporting that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was \u201ca follower of radical Islam\u201d who had \u201cchanged drastically since 2010\u201d and was preparing to travel to Russia\u2019s turbulent Caucasus to connect with underground militant groups. Six months later, Russia sent the same warning to the C.I.A.On April 15, law enforcement officials say, Mr. Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, set off bombs at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and maiming many others.The Russian warnings to the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. also raised questions about Mr. Tsarnaev\u2019s mother, Zubeidat, according to two senior American officials. The Russians were most concerned about Mr. Tsarnaev because they had information that he planned to travel to Russia, according to one of the officials. \u201cThe Russians were concerned that mother and son were very religious and strong believers, and they could be militants if they returned to Russia,\u201d the other official said.The mother, the officials said, did not fit the profile of a potential extremist, leading American counterterrorism officials to not express much concern about her. They did not set up a travel alert on her, for instance, one of the officials said. But they nonetheless added her name to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE database, when Tamerlan\u2019s name was added to it in October 2011, the official said.",

        "context": "Boston Bombing Suspect Found GuiltyBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on all counts Wednesday in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings by a federal jury that now must decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be executed.Jurors spent slightly more than 11 hours deciding Tsarnaev's guilt in two days of deliberations after 16 days of testimony.\"It's not something that will ever be over,\" said Karen Brassard, whose ankles and shin were injured by pieces of the bomb. \"You'll feel it forever. It's forever a part of our life. ... I don't know what justice is. I'm grateful to have him off the street.''Two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, killing three people \u2013 Martin Richard, 8, Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29 \u2013 and wounding more than 260 others.Tsarnaev also was convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology patrol officer shot to death three days later, as Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, attempted to evade police.The defendant, dressed in a blue sweater and dark blazer, looked pale as he entered the courtroom to hear the verdict. His lawyer, Judy Clarke, gave him a brief pat on the back as he sat down.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported Tsarnaev folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy, murder and use of a weapon of mass destruction.There were some families of victims in the courtroom, and their reaction as the verdict was read was very calm, Tlisova observed. She noted, though, they seemed satisfied with the verdict, judging by discussions she had with them outside the courthouse.Seventeen of the counts are capital offenses, making Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty.\u201cI hope today\u2019s verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon,\u201d Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said in a statement. \u201cThe incidents of those days have forever left a mark on our city.\u201dJudy Clarke, left, and David Bruck, defense attorneys for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will try to prevent his getting a death sentence. They're shown at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, April 6, 2015.Penalty phaseDuring the penalty phase, which could begin as early as Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life.That could include evidence about his family, his relationship with his brother, and his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile Dagestan region of Russia.Tsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings.But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, defense attorney Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic Chechen who emigrated from Russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Jurors' questionsEarlier Wednesday, the jury asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to clarify two legal terms.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.They asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. O'Toole explained it applied to a plot between Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev that existed from February through April 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.Jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas. The judge said the terms represent a single concept.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947, and Roman Catholic bishops in the state reiterated their opposition to the death penalty on Monday, when the first phase of the trial wrapped up.VOA's Fatima Tlisova contributed to this report from Boston, and some material for this report came from Reuters, AFP and AP.Watch video report from VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this video0:03:18\u25b60:00:00/0:03:18\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.0MB360p | 8.5MB486p | 70.7MB/*<![CDATA[*/initInfographics({groups:[],params:[{\"Name\":\"embed_code\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;div class=\\\"storify\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts/embed?border=false\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"750\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts.js?border=false\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt;[\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u0026gt;View the story \\\"Boston Bomber Convicted on All Counts\\\" on Storify\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;]\\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"String\"}],isMobile:true});Error rendering storify.(function(d){var userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_code\"],notRenderedS = d.querySelectorAll(\".storifySnippet:not(.storifySnippetRendered)\"),render = function() {try {var oEval = d.createElement(\"div\");oEval.innerHTML = userInput;} catch(e) {var snippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastSnippet = snippets[snippets.length - 1];lastSnippet.innerHTML = \"Storify Embed Code is Invalid or Incomplete.\";return;}var oScript = oEval.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]if (oScript && oScript.getAttribute(\"src\").match(/^(https?:)?\\/\\/(www\\.)?storify\\.com\\/([^\\.])+\\.js/gi) !== null) {var lastNotRenderedS = notRenderedS[notRenderedS.length - 1];lastNotRenderedS.innerHTML = \"\";var iframeEle = oEval.getElementsByTagName(\"iframe\")[0];lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(iframeEle);var scriptEle = d.createElement(\"script\");scriptEle.type = \"text\\/javascript\";scriptEle.src = oScript.src;lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(scriptEle);var noscriptEle = oEval.getElementsByTagName(\"noscript\")[0];lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(noscriptEle);lastNotRenderedS.className = lastNotRenderedS.className + \" storifySnippetRendered\";var findAncestor = function (el, cls) {while ((el = el.parentElement) && !el.classList.contains(cls));return el;};var storifySnippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastStorifyS = storifySnippets[storifySnippets.length - 1];var attach = findAncestor(lastStorifyS,\"infgraphicsAttach\");attach.style.width = \"100%\";attach.style.overflow = \"visible\";}};if (d.readyState === \"uninitialized\" || d.readyState === \"loading\")window.addEventListener(\"load\", render);else //liveblog, ajaxrender();})(document);",

        "context": "Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.",

        "context": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.",

        "context": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.",

        "context": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it exploded, killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting-room",

        "context": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.",

        "context": "Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.",

        "context": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

        "context": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

        "context": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A homemade bomb set off last week by a Canadian man who was apparently inspired by Islamic State, failed to fully detonate, a senior police official told the National Post newspaper on Saturday.Slideshow ( 2 images )While there was a blast in the back seat of a taxi in Strathroy, Ontario, as police closed in, it came from the detonators, and explosive material did not go off, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner Mike Cabana said.The RCMP could not immediately be reached for comment on the newspaper report.Aaron Driver, 24, was shot dead by police on Aug. 10 and the taxi company in the small town said the driver sustained only minor injuries in the blast.Cabana did not go into further detail on the bomb. He said forensic investigation was still underway. The target of what police have said was an attack plotted by Driver was unclear.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting Islamic State on social media, but was never charged with a crime. Islamic State militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and they have supporters and sympathizers around the world who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.In February, Driver was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements. It required he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.The RCMP has said officers sought out Driver on Aug. 10 after a tip from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, which included a \u201cmartyrdom video.\u201dCabana said police identified Driver from the video in part through his choice of balaclava.The incident called into question Canada\u2019s capabilities to combat extremism and increased calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to abandon his plan to scale back a 2015 law that gave increased powers to police and intelligence agents.",

        "context": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.Here's a look at the details:What happened?Assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward Maduro, his wife and other top Venezuelan leaders, according to the Associated Press.The attack occurred while Maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in Caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. One of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to Interior Minister Nestor Reverol.The Venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. The second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where Maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, Reverol said.Photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding Maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"That drone came after me,\" Maduro said. \"But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live for many more years.\"Who launched the drone attack?The Venezuelan government alleges that Maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in Miami and Bogota, Colombia, to try to kill Maduro. They have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that Maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.Government authorities said Sunday that they have detained six people \u2013 whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" \u2013 in connection with the attack. Among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.Maduro accused the \u201cfar right,\u201d working with conspirators in Miami and Bogota \u2013including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos \u2013 of launching the attack. Colombia\u2019s government has denied any role in the violence.Maduro, who accuses the U.S. of supporting his opponents, called on President Donald Trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support Maduro's claims.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it,\" Bolton said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"What is the political and economic situation in Venezuela?Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the Great Depression that devastated the United States and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.The inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. There are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed into Colombia, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the Venezuelans sweeping into that nation.Maduro is viewed by the United States and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. He won re-election to a six-year term in May, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.What could happen next?Reverol said there could be more arrests. Critics fear an even greater government crackdown on Maduro's political opponents.\"The investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" Maduro said. \"No matter who falls.\"More:Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says drone attack was 'attempt to kill me'More:Venezuelan opposition leaders taken from their homes by state security agents",

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the streetPolice officer at the sceneFrom the outset, the IRA's bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit.Such was the scale of the attack, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being detonated.As one report at the time described the scene, \"it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe\".Car bombsWhile the scale of the attack was huge, it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast.At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed.When the emergency services reached the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11.At the Cavehill Road bomb, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy.Of the 130 injured, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.\"You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,\" he told the series.Collapsed ceasefireIn terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster.Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities.It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time.Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofainBy June, the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed.Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible.But after causing the deaths, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings.Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge.Within 10 days of the attacks, the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides.DenialsIn later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility.\"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,\" he said.\"Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.\"Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972. It remains the bloodiest year of the conflict in Northern Ireland.By the end of 1972, 496 had been killed, 258 of them civilians.",

        "context": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

        "context": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.",

        "context": "The owner of a body shop and truck rental agency in Junction City, Kan., identified Timothy McVeigh in court Friday as the man who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.\"I was looking right at him,\" declared Eldon Elliott, owner of Elliott's Body Shop, recalling the two occasions when McVeigh, now 29, entered his shop--on April 15, 1995, to reserve a truck and pay the $280.32 rental fee in advance; and on April 17 to pick up the 20-foot Ryder truck. He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

        "context": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

        "context": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A homemade bomb set off last week by a Canadian man who was apparently inspired by Islamic State, failed to fully detonate, a senior police official told the National Post newspaper on Saturday.Slideshow ( 2 images )While there was a blast in the back seat of a taxi in Strathroy, Ontario, as police closed in, it came from the detonators, and explosive material did not go off, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner Mike Cabana said.The RCMP could not immediately be reached for comment on the newspaper report.Aaron Driver, 24, was shot dead by police on Aug. 10 and the taxi company in the small town said the driver sustained only minor injuries in the blast.Cabana did not go into further detail on the bomb. He said forensic investigation was still underway. The target of what police have said was an attack plotted by Driver was unclear.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting Islamic State on social media, but was never charged with a crime. Islamic State militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and they have supporters and sympathizers around the world who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.In February, Driver was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements. It required he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.The RCMP has said officers sought out Driver on Aug. 10 after a tip from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, which included a \u201cmartyrdom video.\u201dCabana said police identified Driver from the video in part through his choice of balaclava.The incident called into question Canada\u2019s capabilities to combat extremism and increased calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to abandon his plan to scale back a 2015 law that gave increased powers to police and intelligence agents.",

        "context": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it exploded, killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting-room",

        "context": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

British police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group\u2019s affiliate in the North African country to plot the attack and to receive training.Known to police The portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.Some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of Manchester United and keen enthusiast of computer games.They insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. British security services acknowledged Abedi was known to them \u2014 there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant \u2014 but they did not see him as a high risk.Others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of IS. They say he started to pray openly in the streets.A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, May 24, 2017.A local imam, Mohammed Saeed, told British newspapers Abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over IS. \u201cSalman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn\u2019t particularly friendly towards me because he didn\u2019t like my anti-IS sermons. He didn\u2019t like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.\u201dSon of Libyan emigresAbedi was born in Manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. His parents were Libyan emigres who found a home in the northern English city after fleeing the Moammar Gadhafi regime in 1980.His father, Ramadan Abedi, a former security guard at Manchester Airport, returned to Libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the Libyan autocrat. Since Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow his parents spent more time in the North African country than in their home in south Manchester, less than two miles from the scene of Monday\u2019s bombing.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Libyan emigres in Manchester say the bomber\u2019s father had no time for jihadist ideology. \u201cHe was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this ISIS thing isn\u2019t even jihad, it\u2019s criminality. The family will be devastated,\u201d one told local newspapers.According to the Daily Mirror newspaper, Abedi was a family friend of Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, who helped recruit other young Britons for Islamic State via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. British police sources say his ties to Hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear Abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to Libya in the run-up to the bombing.Police also remain skeptical that Abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.RadicalizationAbedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby Salford University. In a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. He turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.\u201dA sign on the front door of a house reads \"Stop Knocking On This Door - We Know Nothing About This Family!!\" is pictured on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017.In the last year-and-half both Abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old Ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. Police arrested Ismail Monday night hours after the blast. He taught Arabic classes at the Didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.Police are also probing the links between the Abedi brothers and another British-Libyan from Manchester, Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.Some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about Abedi. In a recent study of young British jihadists for the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank, researcher Emma Webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.She urged police and social services to share \u201crelevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.\u201d",

        "context": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

They did not set up a travel alert on her, for instance, one of the officials said.

        "context": "Unmanned aircraft primed specifically to chase and catch weaponised consumer drones will be taken for a spin in the coming months.Anti-drone unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are to be taken for counter-terrorist test flights on a UK military base, E&T has learned.It is understood they will be flown in exercises designed to simulate a real-life pursuit of a terrorist drone.Police and the military are believed to be concerned about the prospect of terrorists modifying small, off-the-shelf drones to launch attacks on British soil.Capturing drones using swarms of net-casting UAVs working in tandem is one of several options being considered by defence chiefs.Developing radio frequency denial systems to create a forcefield-type wall around government sensitive areas could also form part of the longer-term strategy.British engineering firm OpenWorks already manufactures the SkyWall 100, an anti-drone bazooka which launches a net at flying objects and parachutes them to the ground.However, James Rogers, an expert in drone warfare who is associate lecturer at the University of York, predicted \u201cnon-kinetic options\u201d would ultimately prove more effective than \u201cblunt force\u201d tactics.\u201cThere are loads of different ways to bring down a drone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now about finding what is the most effective way to do it. If you shoot it down, well, what if it\u2019s rigged as an improvised explosive device?\u201dOn being told about the upcoming test flight event, he said: \u201cThere is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small drones, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\u201dThe ISIL terror group has already used basic, easy-to-buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul, where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self-styled caliphate.US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to carry hazardous chemicals, radioactive material or grenades in Western cities.Rogers told E&T: \u201cWe talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare. This is kind of the other side of it. These are precision missiles. You can hone in on your exact target. Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is.\u201dForcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre-set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum, Rogers said, although he added: \u201cYou can always override that, so it\u2019s a hard one.\u201dIn the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country\u2019s critical infrastructure.It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists.One well-placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far. Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were \u201cjust morons\u201d, he added.A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of colliding with a drone. The person controlling the drone was never tracked down.All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games, according to Dave Sloggett, who runs exercises for the police, military and others.\u201cFor the last nine months, every single exercise I\u2019ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere,\u201d said Sloggett, who has also authored a book on drone warfare.Criminals have been known to use drones to carry drugs and mobile phones into prisons, over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe.Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons.The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so-called \u201cbiomimetic technology\u201d, producing drones based on natural forms, apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments.At the same time, the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries.",

        "context": "Questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Friday.Anecdotes suggest that Tamerlan became more religious in the last several years and may have embraced more conservative Islamic ideas, although no link has been established between him and any known terrorist group.On Monday, a spokesman for the Islamic Society of Boston, a Cambridge mosque frequented by Tamerlan, contributed to the emerging debate over the suspect\u2019s religious beliefs by sharing an anecdote from a January talk at the mosque, during which Tamerlan disrupted the event and insulted the speaker, accusing him of deviating from Islam by comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Martin Luther King Jr.It was the second time that Tamerlan disrupted an event at the mosque because he felt that its religious message was too liberal, said the spokesman, Yusufi Vali, according to a report in The Boston Globe.In disrupting the talk in January at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s shouted at a speaker: \u201cYou are a Kafir\u201d \u2014 a nonbeliever, according to Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque.Tsarnaev went on to say the speaker was contaminating people\u2019s minds and accused him of being a hypocrite.The congregation disagreed, according to Vali, and \u201cshouted him out of the mosque\u201d on Prospect Street.Tsarnaev also interrupted a talk last November when a speaker said it was fine for people to celebrate holidays such as Thanksgiving and July 4, in the same way you celebrate the birthday of the Prophet.Tsarnaev challenged him and the two talked after service.\u201cThe brother was angry, but he left,\u2019\u2019 Vali said.The Islamic Society of Boston issued a news release on Monday afternoon detailing the organization\u2019s interactions with the suspects, who it said were \u201cneither members nor regular attendees\u201d of religious services there.The statement focused almost exclusively on Tamerlan, who the organization said had begun coming \u201cintermittently\u201d to weekly Friday Prayers and \u201coccasionally\u201d to daily services about a year ago.It said Dzhokhar \u201cwas rarely seen at the center, coming only occasionally for prayer.\u201dThe statement included lengthy descriptions of the incidents in January and November when Tamerlan disrupted events at the mosque, leading the community there to reprimand and ostracize him.On November 16, 2012, at our weekly congregational prayer, one of our preachers sermonized that it was appropriate to celebrate national holidays like July 4th and Thanksgiving, just like the birthday of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).The older suspect stood up during the sermon and challenged the preacher, arguing that celebration of any holiday was not allowed in the faith.After the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.The suspect repeatedly argued his viewpoint, and then left.On January 18, 2013, one of our preachers noted that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great person remembered in history.The older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a \u201cnonbeliever\u201d; said that he was \u201ccontaminating people\u2019s minds\u201d; and began calling him a hypocrite.People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, \u201cLeave now!\u201d Due to the congregation\u2019s disapproval, he left the sermon.After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.The statement said that no member of the mosque\u2019s board or staff \u201cever interacted\u201d with either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan, who it said \u201cdisagreed with the moderate American-Islamic theology of the I.S.B.Cambridge mosque.\u201d\u201cOur mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWhile these suspects did express views counter to our mosque\u2019s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.If they had, the F.B.I.would have immediately been called.\u201dOn Saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to Twitter by several people, including Steve Annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to Boston Magazine.Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.They were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1ZWxagi \u2014 Steve Annear (@steveannear) 21 Apr 13The note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the Boston Marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the F.B.I.with any information they may have about the Tsarnaev brothers.The statement was also posted on the mosque\u2019s Web site.",

He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the explosion an \u201cattack\u201d.Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery.French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion. Photograph: Police National/Handout/EPAThe suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said.Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device.Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face.Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France\u2019s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols.The Women\u2019s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June. Lyon will host the semi-finals and then the 7 July final. After the explosion, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201cpublic sites and sporting, cultural and religious events\u201d.On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery.

he also declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" \u2014 just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(And that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)After the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, Davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as Boston planned to re-open on Tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"Boston police and the FBI were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.At a late afternoon press conference with Patrick, Davis initially reported a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.At a second police briefing, Davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as CNN reported that the FBI had classified the event as a terrorist attack.Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"At a White House briefing shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time on a quiet day in Washington, President Obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.He did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" \u2014 \"America will say a prayer for Boston tonight,\" he said \u2014 before delivering a more forceful message:We don't yet have all the answers ...We still do not know who did this or why...But make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.We will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.NBC News and others reported that the White House said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Tuesday.As the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the Boston police scanner, the Boston Globe live blog, and the local CBS, ABC, and Fox stations \u2014 as well as some solid Twitter lists.The basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.After two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. Boston Police would go on to confirm at least three dead \u2014 NBC News cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the Boston Globe \u2014 and 141 injuries.As for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.ABC News reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.Meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from Copley Square area to makeshift tents, from Boston hospitals to Instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.Scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.You can follow all of The Atlantic Wire's ongoing Boston Marathon bomb coverage right here \u2014 and our Day Two aftermath updates here.The CasualtiesThe Boston Marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.Also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-TIPS.The Boston chapter of the American Red Cross said on Monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.The Red Cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.Reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.In a Monday night press conference, Dr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Mass.General Hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.Fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.Other local hospitals \u2014 some of the best in the nation \u2014 are flooded:Injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: Boston Children\u2019s 8; Brigham 27; BMC 23; MGH 22; BI 21; St E's, 15; Tufts 9 \u2014 The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) April 16, 2013An update at the official law enforcement press conference Monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.CNN reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.The New York Post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a Saudi national\u2014officials have not confirmed this and Boston PD has not confirmed this.CBS News is reporting that Boston PD has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"There are various reports on Twitter of a suspect being detained, but Davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the Post and elsewhere.Among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to The Boston Globe.Of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.The \"Person of Interest\"For now, Boston Police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials \u2014 including the new FBI investigator \u2014 would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.Throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the New York Post about a \"Saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from Fox News.Another report in the Los Angeles Times said one person \u2014 not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a Saudi national \u2014 was being questioned.\"A federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a Saudi national who was taken to a Boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"The person was not identified as a suspect.\"Later on Monday evening The Globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in Marathon bombings at Brigham and Women's Hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.However, the paper maintains, \"The situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"Officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on Monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.The New York Times reports, \"Although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"Meanwhile, the FBI is asking for people to send in any info \u2014 photos, video, tips \u2014 or to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with information regarding the explosions.The investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.Reports of a police search at a Revere, Mass.condo complex between five and six on Monday night lit up Twitter.However, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.The Other DevicesSoon after the initial explosions, Boston Globe photographer David L. Ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and Boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"There were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the AP.A spokeswoman at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while The Boston Globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of Boylston Street.Over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.That number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around Boston and neighboring cities.The Boston Globe reported another device found near Harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the Financial District.There were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as Newton, though local police have denied those claims.Again, the Journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.And then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.Here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout Monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown Boston and beyond \u2014 even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:The FBI said on Monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.Meanwhile, the Navy has sent an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team to help with the effort.The Pictures and Video of the ExplosionHere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:Explosion at coply twitter.com/Boston_to_a_T/\u2026 \u2014 Boston to a T (@Boston_to_a_T) April 15, 2013And one more:Just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s\u2026 \u2014 Chris Chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) April 15, 2013Here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the Globe:Here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of Twitter's Vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):We're going to link to these next two shots (WARNING \u2014 they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to Reddit.NECN's Jackie Bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:I saw people's legs blown off.Horrific.Two explosions.Runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.\u2014 Jackie Bruno (@JackieBrunoNECN) April 15, 2013To be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.Because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (CBS News reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in Boston, and the Secret Service set up a perimeter around the White House) as there are graphic images.There are amputations.Here are some of the first photos to hit the AP wire (WARNING \u2014 it is graphic):This photo from Reuters photographer John Tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:Check out this Tumblr post where you can see Tlumacki taking the photo.And one more from The Boston Globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/GlobeDavidLRya\u2026 \u2014 David L. Ryan (@GlobeDavidLRyan) April 15, 2013Here are more photos from The Atlantic's In Focus blog.Here's video of the first explosion:And another close-up video from the explosion:Here's how a marathon runner saw things:And here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.Here is the photo of Obama on the phone with FBI Director Robert Mueller (official White House photo by Pete Souza):Here is text of President Obama's full remarks at the White House.Adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of Newtown.The Eyewitness AccountsThe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.One of the more powerful ones we've read comes from The New York Times, which spoke to Rhode Island state trooper and former Marine Roupen Bastajian.\"These runners just finished and they don\u2019t have legs now,\" said Bastajian.\"So many of them.There are so many people without legs.It's all blood.There's blood everywhere.You got bones, fragments.It's disgusting.\"Several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.Two worth reading come from The Wall Street Journal reporter Coleen McCain Nelson and Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki.Our own Richard Lawson, a Boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:Marathon Monday is one of Boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.By the time the Boston Marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow Boylston Street, it has entered the busy commercial district of Copley Square.The historic Boston Public Library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of Copley Square Park and the famous Trinity Church.And of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in Boston at any time throughout the year.The crowd on marathon day is dense and varied \u2014 locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.And of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.\u2014Richard LawsonAs the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, Astronaut Chris Hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the International Space Station.\"A somber Spring night in Boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:Closer to home, some folks at MIT paid tribute to the patriotic spirit with an entire building:Stay tuned for the Wire's Day Two live blog and more at our Boston Marathon hub.Want to add to this story?Let us know in comments or send an email to the authors at , aabadsantos at theatlantic dot com or matt dot sullivan at theatlantic dot com.You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire.Adam Clark EstesAlexander Abad-SantosMatt Sullivan",

I don't know who exactly framed them, but they did. They framed them. And they were so cowardly that they shot the boy dead,\u201d he told Reuters, clasping his head in despair.\u201cI'm scared for my boy - that they will shoot him dead too,\u201d said the thin man in a black-and-blue sweater. \u201cThey should arrest him, bring him in, alive.

The bag contained altered fireworks the friends threw away.Tazhayakov faces up to 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge and a maximum of five years in jail on the conspiracy charge. His sentencing is scheduled for October 16.Twin bombs exploded near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.Police say that two ethnic Chechen brothers who had lived in the United States for a decade, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried the bombs in backpacks to the Boston street near the finish line before detonating them. Days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gun battle with police and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Authorities say he left a hand-scrawled confession inside the boat that said the bombings were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Muslims in American-led wars overseas.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is in a U.S. prison awaiting trial on multiple charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction.",

Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

        "context": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

Occurring just three days before Spain\u2019s general elections, the attacks had major political consequences.Madrid; terrorism Rescue workers evacuating the bodies of victims of a terrorist train bombing near Atocha Station, Madrid, March 11, 2004. Paul White\u2014AP/REX/Shutterstock.comBritannica Quiz History Makers: Fact or Fiction? Albert Einstein believed that mathematics problems should have very complex solutions.Both the Spanish government and the Spanish media immediately attributed the bombings to ETA, a Basque separatist organization whose campaign of violence over more than 30 years had claimed the lives of at least 800 people. Indeed, \u00c1ngel Acebes, the country\u2019s interior minister, claimed, \u201cThere is no doubt ETA is responsible.\u201d In an outpouring of grief and defiance, the following day an estimated 11 million Spaniards, including some 2.3 million in Madrid alone, participated in demonstrations against the violence and in support of the victims. This display of unity rapidly broke down, however, as the police investigation began to focus on the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. On March 13, as the first arrests were being made, the government continued to blame ETA.That evening spontaneous protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities as demonstrators chanted, \u201cWe want to know the truth before we vote.\u201d With some 90 percent of Spaniards opposed to Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar\u2019s support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Islamic connection inevitably put Iraq back on top of the political agenda. This favoured the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE), which had strongly opposed the war. On March 14 the PSOE scored an upset victory at the polls, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero was sworn in as prime minister three days later.In October 2007, 18 Islamic fundamentalists of mainly North African origin and three Spanish accomplices were convicted of the bombings (seven others were acquitted), which were one of Europe\u2019s deadliest terrorist attacks in the years since World War II.",

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

Beginning at 7:37 am and continuing for several minutes, 10 bombs exploded on four trains in and around Atocha Station in the city\u2019s centre, leaving 191 dead and more than 1,800 injured. Occurring just three days before Spain\u2019s general elections, the attacks had major political consequences.Madrid; terrorism Rescue workers evacuating the bodies of victims of a terrorist train bombing near Atocha Station, Madrid, March 11, 2004. Paul White\u2014AP/REX/Shutterstock.comBritannica Quiz History Makers: Fact or Fiction? Albert Einstein believed that mathematics problems should have very complex solutions.Both the Spanish government and the Spanish media immediately attributed the bombings to ETA, a Basque separatist organization whose campaign of violence over more than 30 years had claimed the lives of at least 800 people. Indeed, \u00c1ngel Acebes, the country\u2019s interior minister, claimed, \u201cThere is no doubt ETA is responsible.\u201d In an outpouring of grief and defiance, the following day an estimated 11 million Spaniards, including some 2.3 million in Madrid alone, participated in demonstrations against the violence and in support of the victims. This display of unity rapidly broke down, however, as the police investigation began to focus on the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. On March 13, as the first arrests were being made, the government continued to blame ETA.That evening spontaneous protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities as demonstrators chanted, \u201cWe want to know the truth before we vote.\u201d With some 90 percent of Spaniards opposed to Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar\u2019s support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Islamic connection inevitably put Iraq back on top of the political agenda. This favoured the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE), which had strongly opposed the war. On March 14 the PSOE scored an upset victory at the polls, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero was sworn in as prime minister three days later.In October 2007, 18 Islamic fundamentalists of mainly North African origin and three Spanish accomplices were convicted of the bombings (seven others were acquitted), which were one of Europe\u2019s deadliest terrorist attacks in the years since World War II.",

        "context": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her.

She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family.

His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out.

        "context": "The owner of a body shop and truck rental agency in Junction City, Kan., identified Timothy McVeigh in court Friday as the man who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.\"I was looking right at him,\" declared Eldon Elliott, owner of Elliott's Body Shop, recalling the two occasions when McVeigh, now 29, entered his shop--on April 15, 1995, to reserve a truck and pay the $280.32 rental fee in advance; and on April 17 to pick up the 20-foot Ryder truck. He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

        "context": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it exploded, killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting-room",

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her.

But, he adds, many others are compelled out of fear.Maria\u2019s mom at PDVSAMartha \u2014like all names, changed for this story\u2014 wouldn\u2019t talk to me.

She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family. Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.On Sunday, workers are being told to go to the plant first thing. They\u2019ll be put on buses to the voting centers. Managers are responsible for making sure the workers participate, and have lists saying where each worker votes. They must show up in the company\u2019s uniform too \u2014for the picture.Betania\u2019s dad is determined to vote. He has to protect his job; he\u2019s about to retire, he won\u2019t risk it. His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names.

whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.That's what we don't yet know.And clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation.\"In a post expanding on the memo,Time's Crowley noted the ease of creating such an explosive device.\"The ability to make these bombs is hardly unique to al Qaeda and its sympathizers.Details on how to make a pressure cooker bomb can also be found on websites associated with anarchy and other forms of non-religious radicalism,\" he said, before linking to such a website.Other evidence suggests that the bombs were made with readily-available chemicals.New Scientistasked a bomb expert to study the footage of the explosion for clues of the bombs origin.Here's what the expert concluded: \"The Boston bombs ... produced an orange flash followed by white smoke.This suggests the bombs contained neither TNT nor RDX, which produce black smoke, but could have been a home-made chlorate-based device.\"Update, 5:04 p.m.:ABC News is reporting that one of the bombs used gunpowder to detonate.It's unclear how the bombs detonatedIn the same report detailing how the bombs were built, the Associated Press notes, \"law enforcement officials have some of the bomb components but [do] not yet know what was used to set off the explosives.\"In that vacuum of knowledge a number of rumors have appeared: 1) the bombs used a timer; 2) the bombs were activated remotely; 3) cell phone service was shut down in downtown Boston to avert other remotely-activated bombs; and 4) a mysterious roof-top figure captured in a single photo hassomethingto do with setting off the bomb.Rumor No.1 appears to be the strongest.After speaking to an official close to the investigation, CNN knocked down rumors (discussed below) that the bomb had been detonated using a cell phone-activated trigger, and reported that investigators in Boston think the bombs had timers attached to them instead.And, within minutes of CNN's report, theGlobereported that investigators had turned up a circuit board they believe was used to trigger the explosions; it was reportedly found near a spot where Gov.Patrick had been seated earlier in the day.",

Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.",

Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.",

British police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group\u2019s affiliate in the North African country to plot the attack and to receive training.Known to police The portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.Some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of Manchester United and keen enthusiast of computer games.They insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. British security services acknowledged Abedi was known to them \u2014 there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant \u2014 but they did not see him as a high risk.Others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of IS. They say he started to pray openly in the streets.A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, May 24, 2017.A local imam, Mohammed Saeed, told British newspapers Abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over IS. \u201cSalman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn\u2019t particularly friendly towards me because he didn\u2019t like my anti-IS sermons. He didn\u2019t like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.\u201dSon of Libyan emigresAbedi was born in Manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. His parents were Libyan emigres who found a home in the northern English city after fleeing the Moammar Gadhafi regime in 1980.His father, Ramadan Abedi, a former security guard at Manchester Airport, returned to Libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the Libyan autocrat. Since Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow his parents spent more time in the North African country than in their home in south Manchester, less than two miles from the scene of Monday\u2019s bombing.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Libyan emigres in Manchester say the bomber\u2019s father had no time for jihadist ideology. \u201cHe was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this ISIS thing isn\u2019t even jihad, it\u2019s criminality. The family will be devastated,\u201d one told local newspapers.According to the Daily Mirror newspaper, Abedi was a family friend of Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, who helped recruit other young Britons for Islamic State via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. British police sources say his ties to Hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear Abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to Libya in the run-up to the bombing.Police also remain skeptical that Abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.RadicalizationAbedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby Salford University. In a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. He turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.\u201dA sign on the front door of a house reads \"Stop Knocking On This Door - We Know Nothing About This Family!!\" is pictured on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017.In the last year-and-half both Abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old Ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. Police arrested Ismail Monday night hours after the blast. He taught Arabic classes at the Didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.Police are also probing the links between the Abedi brothers and another British-Libyan from Manchester, Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.Some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about Abedi. In a recent study of young British jihadists for the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank, researcher Emma Webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.She urged police and social services to share \u201crelevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.\u201d",

The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.Despite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.The bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==Background==McGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre. This was a mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. The pub was owned by Patrick and Philomena McGurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was formed in Belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". The British Army was deployed in Northern Ireland following the August 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the Troubles. In December 1969 the IRA split into two factions: the 'Official' IRA and Provisional IRA. Both launched armed campaigns against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the government of Northern Ireland.During 1971, the violence gradually worsened. There were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. During the first two weeks of December, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. On 2 December, three republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road prison, not far from McGurk's. Security was tightened and there was a heavy RUC and British Army presence in the area over the next two days. Eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around McGurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.==Bombing==On the evening of Saturday 4 December 1971, a four-man UVF team met in the Shankill area of Belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on North Queen Street. According to the only convicted bomber\u2014Robert Campbell\u2014they were told not to return until the job was done. Campbell said that their target had not been McGurk's, but another pub nearby. It is believed this was a pub called The Gem, which was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. The  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. Campbell says they stopped near The Gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. After waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to McGurk's. At about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on Great George's Street and rushed back to the car. It exploded just moments after they drove off. Campbell implied that McGurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest Catholic pub\".The blast caused the building to collapse. Bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. Firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. Fifteen Catholic civilians had been killed\u2014including two children\u2014and a further seventeen wounded. The rescue effort lasted many hours.Within two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the New Lodge\u2013Tiger's Bay interface. The British Army and RUC moved in and a gun battle developed. A British Army officer, Major Jeremy Snow, was shot by the IRA on New Lodge Road and died of his wounds on 8 December. Two RUC officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. Eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.Meanwhile, the UVF team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. They walked to the area of St Anne's Cathedral and were picked up by another. They were driven back to the Shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an Orange Hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".Among those killed were Philomena and Maria McGurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner Patrick McGurk. Patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. Shortly after the attack, McGurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"It doesn't matter who planted the bomb. What's done can't be undone. I've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"==Investigation=====Responsibility===After the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. The main theories were:*that it had been planted by loyalists;*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by IRA members inside the pub;*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an IRA member having left it in the pub to be collected by another IRA member; and*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA.The security forces promoted the idea that it was an IRA bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). Survivors and relatives denied this. They said the pub was not associated with the IRA and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. An Intelligence Corps document from December 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have IRA associations. On 6 December, both wings of the IRA condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the UVF and security forces.====Claims of responsibility====That same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"Empire Loyalists\". Their statement to the Belfast Telegraph was:We [the Empire Loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of McGurk's pub. We placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of IRA Provisionals and Officials were held there. The \"Empire Loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 November. The RUC, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.On Tuesday 7 December, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. He said the man was wearing a jacket with a UVF badge on it. The youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. When put together, it included the lines:We the Empire Loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy McGurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... Furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the Army to cover up for us ... We shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.In the days following the bombing, the RUC received a letter signed by \"Chief of Staff, UVF\" claiming that the UVF bombed the pub because an IRA meeting was due to take place there. It said that two UVF members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". Witnesses told the RUC, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. Three other unsigned letters were sent to the RUC, claiming it was an IRA bomb \"in transit\" and that two IRA members were killed.====Location of the bomb====For the RUC, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. However, investigators (both RUC and British Army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.RUC duty officers' reports were made daily. Their purpose was to brief the Chief Constable and others at HQ about events that had happened that day. The reports were also made available to the British Army's General Officer Commanding for Northern Ireland. The 4\u20135 December 1971 report said of the bombing: \"Just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the IRA. The bomb was intended for use on other premises. Before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". The origin of this information could not be established.On 6 December, however, the RUC took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. He said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee Union Jack stuck in the back window\". He said one left a package in the Great George's Street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. A man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. Despite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. A British Intelligence Corps document covering the period 8\u201315 December said: \"It has been confirmed that it was a [Provisional IRA] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" A Ministry of Defence (MOD) document dated 14 December said that this \"should be publicised\". On 23 December, the British Army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north Belfast. It said that when the IRA in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to \u2026 a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [IRA's] accident in the McGurk\u2019s bar.\"===Arrest and conviction of Robert Campbell===In March 1976, the RUC received intelligence that linked UVF member Robert Campbell and four others to the McGurk's bombing. Campbell was arrested on 27 July 1977 and held at Castlereagh RUC base. He was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 July. He admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. Campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.On 29 July 1977, Campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. On 6 September 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a Protestant delivery driver in 1976. He is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. He eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 September 1993.===Collusion claims and Police Ombudsman's investigation===The victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the RUC's investigation was flawed from the outset. Moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were IRA members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). Even after Campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. Relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". Another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the IRA's support and stir tension between the two IRA factions.Relatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. Some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. The 2009 book Killing For Britain, written by former UVF member 'John Black', claimed that the British undercover unit known as the Military Reaction Force or Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA. The plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two IRA factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against British forces and drain their support. However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.On 21 February 2011, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report about the bombing and the RUC's investigation of it. The report said that there is no evidence that the RUC helped the UVF bombers. However, it found that the RUC investigation was biased in favour of the view that the IRA was responsible. It failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. The report also found that RUC gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an IRA bomb. The Ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive Chief Constables have not addressed this mistake. Ombudsman Al Hutchinson said: \"Inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".On 6 December 2012, Scottish Labour MP Michael Connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in Westminster that then-Prime Minister Edward Heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the IRA and spreading the story. Connarty also urged David Cameron, Prime Minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.==Remembrance==In 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of McGurk's Bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. Relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that British forces helped the bombers. Almost a thousand people attended a service at St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.Patrick McGurk died on 15 December 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.==See also==*Dublin and Monaghan bombings*Glasgow pub bombings*Timeline of Ulster Volunteer Force actions==References====External links==* The true story of the McGurk's Bar Massacre, told by the families of the victims themselves.* News Hound \u2013 McGurk's bombing* CAIN \u2013 List of 1971 deaths in the Troubles* House of Commons debate on the bombing*  The NewlodgePlaque near the site of the bombing listing those killed.A mock-up of the original bar erected close to its original location, December 2011.Memorial on Great George's Street.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

        "context": "On 4 December 1971, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at McGurk's Bar in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.Despite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.The bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==Background==McGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre.

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

Andy Richards reveals for the first time the tragic story of young victim Marilyn Paula Nash.An early riser for work, council worker John Smith needed to be on autopilot as he set off as usual on the grey, dismal Friday morning that is forever etched in his memory.Normally, he would have had a spring in his step. After all, all the weekend was beckoning. It was a chance for him to unwind from the office graft, and perhaps enjoy a drink or two.But this wasn\u2019t a normal morning. In fact, there had never been another morning quite like it in the West Midlands.The previous night, well, at that stage all the terrible details were not known. Accounts varied, the death toll was rising.Bombers \u2013 everyone knew they were the IRA, although the terror group had not claimed responsibility \u2013 had destroyed two pubs in Birmingham city centre.Nineteen people were dead, several were clinging to life, two of whom would eventually succumb to dreadful injuries.The number of injured seemed to change with almost every news bulletin, but it was steadily increasing, and by now it was more than 150.On the previous night \u2013 November 21, 1974 \u2013 families across the UK had clustered around TV sets and radios, utterly aghast and trying to take in what the news flashes from Birmingham were showing and describing.In the city, and across the Black Country towns of West Bromwich, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, fear of more attacks, combined with growing anger, was visceral.There had already been a number of reprisal attacks on Irish homes and businesses. The region bristled with tension.John\u2019s head was already full of this as he fastened his coat to leave his Walsall home. Little did he know that the sickening horror of the previous night was on his own doorstep.He stepped out... and into a nightmare scenario.John, now a 74-year-old pensioner and still living in the same terraced property, knows the memories can never be erased.\u201cIt must have been about 7am,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had all heard about the bombs going off in the pubs in Birmingham the night before. The whole area was in shock, people could hardly believe it.\u201dIn his early 30s at the time, on that Friday morning he was intent on catching his usual bus for the daily journey to work at Lichfield Council where he was involved in planning sewerage pipe developments.As he set off from the small close in Pelsall where his family lived, he was confronted by the extraordinary sight of his neighbour, Mr Nash stumbling about in the road \u201clike a lost man\u201d.John remembers his neighbour\u2019s tears and his face \u2013 the face of a man in absolute torment.\u201cHe was simply wandering about, not going anywhere but obviously really upset,\u201d recalls John. \u201cSo naturally I went to him and asked him what was wrong.\u201cHe said his daughter, Marilyn, had been in Birmingham the night before. She still hadn\u2019t come home.\u201dMr Nash was a widower and lived with Marilyn, who was 22, and his son, Robert, in the terraced house next door. John thinks Robert was away studying at university at the time. Either way, there was no-one else at home.With nobody to talk to, Mr Nash\u2019s agony had multiplied with each long hour throughout the blackest of nights.\u201cI tried to comfort him as best I could, but what can you do? What can you say?,\u201d says John. \u201cHis daughter should have been home hours ago. There had been no sign or word of her.\u201cI persuaded him to come back to our house where I left him with my mother before I went on to work. She did her best to help him.\u201dWhatever conversation passed between John\u2019s mother and Mr Nash is not known. Neither is how long the poor man waited for news.But his fears for his daughter were sadly well-founded. She never did come home.It took the authorities some time to confirm that Birmingham shop worker Marilyn Paula Nash \u2013 known as Paula to her family and close friends \u2013 was among the dead.She was an attractive, vivacious young woman, with a hint of Jackie Onassis about her looks and hairstyle.Those tasked with the dreadful job of identifying the dead could only confirm it was her by her wage packet, says John.\u201cI remember that she was a very sweet, very friendly girl,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was my next door neighbour and a reasonably similar age so, although were were not close, we would always say hello, and pass the time of day. Sometimes we would catch the same bus if we were going into Birmingham for a drink, and we would chat.\u201dA fateful decision by Marilyn to pop into a pub for a quick drink on the way home from work cost her her life.It was the penultimate pay day before Christmas. The pubs in Birmingham were full and business was brisk. Marilyn headed for the Tavern In The Town, the underground bar in New Street which had become a cult drinking hole for students and young workers.So did the bombers. They wrought carnage there, and at the nearby Mulberry Bush at the bottom of The Rotunda.\u201cWhen it became known that Marilyn was among the dead, this whole area was in absolute shock,\u201d remembers John. \u201cThere was a big Irish community locally and a local Catholic club was nearby.\u201cI remember the police ordering the Catholic club to be closed for security reasons for a time. I don\u2019t think that was necessary, but I suppose they feared reprisals or trouble and had to be careful.\u201dMr Nash, who later remarried, is understood to have passed away many years ago, and Marilyn\u2019s brother is believed to live in another part of the country.John is probably the only resident from those days still living in the small, tidy street that witnessed such awful events.The homes there are well-kept but nowadays many have signs in their windows making it clear that callers without appointments are not welcome.It suggests the residents prefer keep themselves to themselves.Most probably have no idea of the tragedy that visited the Nash family 42 years ago.(Image: Wesley/Keystone/Getty Images)As for John, his chat with me has clearly stirred recollections that have lay dormant for many years.But he is not optimistic that the new inquest will bring truth or closure to those who still grieve.\u201cLike a good many others I would like to know what really went on that night but...\u201d and here he pauses.\u201cIt may turn something up, but those who did it have got away with it for too long.\u201dEx-IRA chief: Pub attacks left me ashamed and appalled...(Image: Birmingham Mail)The IRA\u2019s involvement in the bombings became clearer with the publication of the memoirs of Kieran Conway, head of the its intelligence-gathering department during the 1970s.In his book Southside Provisional, he confessed that the attacks on the pubs left him \u201cashamed and appalled.\u201dThe attacks on the Birmingham pubs, neither of which had any military connection, \u201cwent against everything we claimed to stand for,\u201d he said.The bombings came after police disrupted the funeral arrangements for James McDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA who blew himself up while trying to attack Coventry Telephone Exchange a few days earlier.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties,\u201d said Conway.He claimed the IRA unit responsible \u201ccould not find a functioning telephone box, so they were unable to issue a warning sufficiently in time to clear the bars and prevent the mass loss of life.\u201dConway finally left the Republican movement in 1993 and is now a criminal lawyer in Dublin.Fighting families\u2019 legal aid problems still to be resolvedRelatives of more than half the victims are hoping to be represented by lawyers at the pre-inquest review hearing on Thursday.But at the time of going to press, longstanding issues of legal aid had still to be resolved.For several months the Government had insisted that KRW Law, the Belfast-based law firm representing most of the families, was not eligible for legal aid.But at the end of last month, there was a U-turn and the Legal Aid Agency is currently considering a fresh application.Legal Aid Minister Sir Oliver Heald QC said: \u201cIt would be a travesty for families to be denied justice simply because of a technicality, which is why I have taken the decision to change the regulations around inquest funding. This will remove any barrier from the families\u2019 solicitors in applying for legal aid funding for the inquest.\u201dThe inquest was re-opened in June last year following a campaign by the families, backed by the Birmingham Mail. The full inquest is expected to take place in September.",

Beginning at 7:37 am and continuing for several minutes, 10 bombs exploded on four trains in and around Atocha Station in the city\u2019s centre, leaving 191 dead and more than 1,800 injured. Occurring just three days before Spain\u2019s general elections, the attacks had major political consequences.Madrid; terrorism Rescue workers evacuating the bodies of victims of a terrorist train bombing near Atocha Station, Madrid, March 11, 2004. Paul White\u2014AP/REX/Shutterstock.comBritannica Quiz History Makers: Fact or Fiction? Albert Einstein believed that mathematics problems should have very complex solutions.Both the Spanish government and the Spanish media immediately attributed the bombings to ETA, a Basque separatist organization whose campaign of violence over more than 30 years had claimed the lives of at least 800 people. Indeed, \u00c1ngel Acebes, the country\u2019s interior minister, claimed, \u201cThere is no doubt ETA is responsible.\u201d In an outpouring of grief and defiance, the following day an estimated 11 million Spaniards, including some 2.3 million in Madrid alone, participated in demonstrations against the violence and in support of the victims. This display of unity rapidly broke down, however, as the police investigation began to focus on the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. On March 13, as the first arrests were being made, the government continued to blame ETA.That evening spontaneous protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities as demonstrators chanted, \u201cWe want to know the truth before we vote.\u201d With some 90 percent of Spaniards opposed to Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar\u2019s support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Islamic connection inevitably put Iraq back on top of the political agenda. This favoured the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE), which had strongly opposed the war. On March 14 the PSOE scored an upset victory at the polls, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero was sworn in as prime minister three days later.In October 2007, 18 Islamic fundamentalists of mainly North African origin and three Spanish accomplices were convicted of the bombings (seven others were acquitted), which were one of Europe\u2019s deadliest terrorist attacks in the years since World War II.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

If you shoot it down, well, what if it\u2019s rigged as an improvised explosive device?\u201dOn being told about the upcoming test flight event, he said: \u201cThere is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small drones, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\u201dThe ISIL terror group has already used basic, easy-to-buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul, where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self-styled caliphate.US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to carry hazardous chemicals, radioactive material or grenades in Western cities.Rogers told E&T: \u201cWe talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare. This is kind of the other side of it. These are precision missiles. You can hone in on your exact target. Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is.\u201dForcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre-set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum, Rogers said, although he added: \u201cYou can always override that, so it\u2019s a hard one.\u201dIn the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country\u2019s critical infrastructure.It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists.One well-placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far. Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were \u201cjust morons\u201d, he added.A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of colliding with a drone. The person controlling the drone was never tracked down.All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games, according to Dave Sloggett, who runs exercises for the police, military and others.\u201cFor the last nine months, every single exercise I\u2019ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere,\u201d said Sloggett, who has also authored a book on drone warfare.Criminals have been known to use drones to carry drugs and mobile phones into prisons, over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe.Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons.The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so-called \u201cbiomimetic technology\u201d, producing drones based on natural forms, apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments.At the same time, the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries.",

        "context": "French police are hunting a suspect believed to have deposited a paper bag containing a device that exploded on Friday, wounding 13 people on a busy pedestrian street in the city of Lyon.France\u2019s counter-terrorism prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said an investigation has been opened for an \u201cattempted murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking\u201d and \u201ccriminal terrorist association\u201d.He said no group had yet claimed responsibility for the explosion. Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the explosion an \u201cattack\u201d.Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery.French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion. Photograph: Police National/Handout/EPAThe suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said.Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device.Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face.Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France\u2019s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols.The Women\u2019s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June. Lyon will host the semi-finals and then the 7 July final. After the explosion, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201cpublic sites and sporting, cultural and religious events\u201d.On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery. Large wood planks covered her shop window, which was damaged by the blast. Police found in her shop screws, metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device, yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning.France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals. Five people were killed on 11 December in an attack on the Christmas market in Strasbourg, eastern France. The alleged killer, Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt \u2013 shot dead by police \u2013 had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.",

He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

        "context": "The 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on December 22, 2001, on American Airlines Flight 63.The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.The perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes.The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident.Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.==Incident==As Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid \u2013 an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom, and self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda operative \u2013 carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives.He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.Passengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service.One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source.She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match.Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention.After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.Moutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help.When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.The  tall Reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords.A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft.Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.Two F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport.The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal.Authorities later found over 280\u00a0grams (10\u00a0oz) of TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft.He pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.== Aftermath ==Six months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence.He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier.This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.In 2006, security procedures at US airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident.The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in the 2010s.Flight Number AAL63 continues to be used on the route from Paris to Miami.==External links==* Bomb on Flight 63 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2015==See also==*1988 Lockerbie Bombing, Pan Am plane destroyed by PETN bomb, killing 270 people \u2013 event happened 13 years exactly prior to the shoe bomb incident* 1994 Philippine Airlines Flight 434, test run for al-Qaeda Operation Bojinka, killing one plane passenger in bombing* 1995 Bojinka plot, al-Qaeda plot to blow up 12 planes as they flew from Asia to the US*2006 Transatlantic Aircraft Plot, failed plot to blow up at least 10 planes as they flew from the UK to the US and Canada*2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, failed al-Qaeda PETN bombing of plane*2010 cargo plane bomb plot, failed al-Qaeda PETN bombing of plane*List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft*List of terrorist incidents, 2001*September 11 Attacks== References ==Richard Reid, the perpetrator of the incident.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the explosion an \u201cattack\u201d.Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery.French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion. Photograph: Police National/Handout/EPAThe suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said.Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device.Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face.Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France\u2019s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols.The Women\u2019s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June.

        "context": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.",

The bag contained altered fireworks the friends threw away.Tazhayakov faces up to 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge and a maximum of five years in jail on the conspiracy charge. His sentencing is scheduled for October 16.Twin bombs exploded near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.Police say that two ethnic Chechen brothers who had lived in the United States for a decade, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried the bombs in backpacks to the Boston street near the finish line before detonating them. Days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gun battle with police and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Authorities say he left a hand-scrawled confession inside the boat that said the bombings were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Muslims in American-led wars overseas.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is in a U.S. prison awaiting trial on multiple charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction.",

        "context": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

        "context": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.",

        "context": "There have been many terrible events in the history of Northern Ireland's conflict, but few have seared the collective consciousness of its people as those on Friday, 21 July 1972, a day that became known as Bloody Friday.By the end of the day, the IRA's Belfast brigade had detonated at least 20 bombs across the city.In just 75 minutes of violence, nine people were dead and some 130 more were mutilated, injured and mentally scarred by what they had witnessed.You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the streetPolice officer at the sceneFrom the outset, the IRA's bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit.Such was the scale of the attack, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being detonated.As one report at the time described the scene, \"it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe\".Car bombsWhile the scale of the attack was huge, it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast.At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed.When the emergency services reached the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11.At the Cavehill Road bomb, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy.Of the 130 injured, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.\"You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,\" he told the series.Collapsed ceasefireIn terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster.Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities.It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time.Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofainBy June, the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed.Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible.But after causing the deaths, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings.Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge.Within 10 days of the attacks, the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides.DenialsIn later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility.\"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,\" he said.\"Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.\"Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972. It remains the bloodiest year of the conflict in Northern Ireland.By the end of 1972, 496 had been killed, 258 of them civilians.",

        "context": "Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.",

The Russians were most concerned about Mr. Tsarnaev because they had information that he planned to travel to Russia, according to one of the officials. \u201cThe Russians were concerned that mother and son were very religious and strong believers, and they could be militants if they returned to Russia,\u201d the other official said.The mother, the officials said, did not fit the profile of a potential extremist, leading American counterterrorism officials to not express much concern about her.

        "context": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it exploded, killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting-room",

        "context": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

If you shoot it down, well, what if it\u2019s rigged as an improvised explosive device?\u201dOn being told about the upcoming test flight event, he said: \u201cThere is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small drones, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\u201dThe ISIL terror group has already used basic, easy-to-buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul, where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self-styled caliphate.US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to carry hazardous chemicals, radioactive material or grenades in Western cities.Rogers told E&T: \u201cWe talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare. This is kind of the other side of it. These are precision missiles. You can hone in on your exact target. Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is.\u201dForcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre-set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum, Rogers said, although he added: \u201cYou can always override that, so it\u2019s a hard one.\u201dIn the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country\u2019s critical infrastructure.It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists.One well-placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far. Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were \u201cjust morons\u201d, he added.A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of colliding with a drone. The person controlling the drone was never tracked down.All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games, according to Dave Sloggett, who runs exercises for the police, military and others.\u201cFor the last nine months, every single exercise I\u2019ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere,\u201d said Sloggett, who has also authored a book on drone warfare.Criminals have been known to use drones to carry drugs and mobile phones into prisons, over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe.Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons.The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so-called \u201cbiomimetic technology\u201d, producing drones based on natural forms, apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments.At the same time, the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries.",

In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it exploded, killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting-room",

        "context": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.",

The bag contained altered fireworks the friends threw away.Tazhayakov faces up to 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge and a maximum of five years in jail on the conspiracy charge. His sentencing is scheduled for October 16.Twin bombs exploded near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.Police say that two ethnic Chechen brothers who had lived in the United States for a decade, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried the bombs in backpacks to the Boston street near the finish line before detonating them. Days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gun battle with police and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Authorities say he left a hand-scrawled confession inside the boat that said the bombings were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Muslims in American-led wars overseas.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is in a U.S. prison awaiting trial on multiple charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her.

She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote.

In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night.

        "context": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car. As a Land-Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved, it exploded, killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting-room",

        "context": "Multiple outlets, law enforcement officials, and President Obama responded throughout a manic Monday with news that a horrific looking scene made clear in downtown Boston, even as a frenzied search for more potential explosive devices continued and hospitals rushed to help survivors: The crowd at the finish line of the Boston Marathon was bombed twice in what is being described as both a coordinated \"event\" and \"an act of terror\" with more than 140 people brutally injured at eight Boston hospitals and at least three dead, including a young child.Indeed, even as a city and a nation came together amidst the chaotic scene, there was not much good news in Boston this April 15 \u2014 the annual Patriot Day, a Massachusetts festival holiday with schools and offices closed for the marathon and, on this particular day, tragedy in the happiest of places.The FBI has taken over \"a potential terrorist investigation,\" FBI special agent in charge Richard DesLauriers said at a Monday evening press conference.\"There is no suspect\" at the hospital, Boston Police commissioner Ed Davis said at the briefing, despite reports to the contrary \u2014 and speculation that there was still one or multiple persons of interest being questioned at the hospital.When asked if there was a person of interest at the hospital, DeLaurio declined to comment; he also declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" \u2014 just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(And that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)After the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, Davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as Boston planned to re-open on Tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"Boston police and the FBI were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.At a late afternoon press conference with Patrick, Davis initially reported a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.At a second police briefing, Davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as CNN reported that the FBI had classified the event as a terrorist attack.Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"At a White House briefing shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time on a quiet day in Washington, President Obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.He did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" \u2014 \"America will say a prayer for Boston tonight,\" he said \u2014 before delivering a more forceful message:We don't yet have all the answers ...We still do not know who did this or why...But make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.We will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.NBC News and others reported that the White House said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Tuesday.As the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the Boston police scanner, the Boston Globe live blog, and the local CBS, ABC, and Fox stations \u2014 as well as some solid Twitter lists.The basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.After two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. Boston Police would go on to confirm at least three dead \u2014 NBC News cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the Boston Globe \u2014 and 141 injuries.As for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.ABC News reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.Meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from Copley Square area to makeshift tents, from Boston hospitals to Instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.Scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.You can follow all of The Atlantic Wire's ongoing Boston Marathon bomb coverage right here \u2014 and our Day Two aftermath updates here.The CasualtiesThe Boston Marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.Also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-TIPS.The Boston chapter of the American Red Cross said on Monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.The Red Cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.Reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.In a Monday night press conference, Dr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Mass.General Hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.Fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.Other local hospitals \u2014 some of the best in the nation \u2014 are flooded:Injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: Boston Children\u2019s 8; Brigham 27; BMC 23; MGH 22; BI 21; St E's, 15; Tufts 9 \u2014 The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) April 16, 2013An update at the official law enforcement press conference Monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.CNN reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.The New York Post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a Saudi national\u2014officials have not confirmed this and Boston PD has not confirmed this.CBS News is reporting that Boston PD has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"There are various reports on Twitter of a suspect being detained, but Davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the Post and elsewhere.Among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to The Boston Globe.Of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.The \"Person of Interest\"For now, Boston Police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials \u2014 including the new FBI investigator \u2014 would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.Throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the New York Post about a \"Saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from Fox News.Another report in the Los Angeles Times said one person \u2014 not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a Saudi national \u2014 was being questioned.\"A federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a Saudi national who was taken to a Boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"The person was not identified as a suspect.\"Later on Monday evening The Globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in Marathon bombings at Brigham and Women's Hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.However, the paper maintains, \"The situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"Officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on Monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.The New York Times reports, \"Although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"Meanwhile, the FBI is asking for people to send in any info \u2014 photos, video, tips \u2014 or to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with information regarding the explosions.The investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.Reports of a police search at a Revere, Mass.condo complex between five and six on Monday night lit up Twitter.However, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.The Other DevicesSoon after the initial explosions, Boston Globe photographer David L. Ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and Boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"There were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the AP.A spokeswoman at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while The Boston Globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of Boylston Street.Over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.That number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around Boston and neighboring cities.The Boston Globe reported another device found near Harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the Financial District.There were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as Newton, though local police have denied those claims.Again, the Journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.And then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.Here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout Monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown Boston and beyond \u2014 even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:The FBI said on Monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.Meanwhile, the Navy has sent an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team to help with the effort.The Pictures and Video of the ExplosionHere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:Explosion at coply twitter.com/Boston_to_a_T/\u2026 \u2014 Boston to a T (@Boston_to_a_T) April 15, 2013And one more:Just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s\u2026 \u2014 Chris Chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) April 15, 2013Here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the Globe:Here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of Twitter's Vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):We're going to link to these next two shots (WARNING \u2014 they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to Reddit.NECN's Jackie Bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:I saw people's legs blown off.Horrific.Two explosions.Runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.\u2014 Jackie Bruno (@JackieBrunoNECN) April 15, 2013To be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.Because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (CBS News reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in Boston, and the Secret Service set up a perimeter around the White House) as there are graphic images.There are amputations.Here are some of the first photos to hit the AP wire (WARNING \u2014 it is graphic):This photo from Reuters photographer John Tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:Check out this Tumblr post where you can see Tlumacki taking the photo.And one more from The Boston Globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/GlobeDavidLRya\u2026 \u2014 David L. Ryan (@GlobeDavidLRyan) April 15, 2013Here are more photos from The Atlantic's In Focus blog.Here's video of the first explosion:And another close-up video from the explosion:Here's how a marathon runner saw things:And here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.Here is the photo of Obama on the phone with FBI Director Robert Mueller (official White House photo by Pete Souza):Here is text of President Obama's full remarks at the White House.Adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of Newtown.The Eyewitness AccountsThe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.One of the more powerful ones we've read comes from The New York Times, which spoke to Rhode Island state trooper and former Marine Roupen Bastajian.\"These runners just finished and they don\u2019t have legs now,\" said Bastajian.\"So many of them.There are so many people without legs.It's all blood.There's blood everywhere.You got bones, fragments.It's disgusting.\"Several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.Two worth reading come from The Wall Street Journal reporter Coleen McCain Nelson and Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki.Our own Richard Lawson, a Boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:Marathon Monday is one of Boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.By the time the Boston Marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow Boylston Street, it has entered the busy commercial district of Copley Square.The historic Boston Public Library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of Copley Square Park and the famous Trinity Church.And of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in Boston at any time throughout the year.The crowd on marathon day is dense and varied \u2014 locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.And of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.\u2014Richard LawsonAs the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, Astronaut Chris Hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the International Space Station.\"A somber Spring night in Boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:Closer to home, some folks at MIT paid tribute to the patriotic spirit with an entire building:Stay tuned for the Wire's Day Two live blog and more at our Boston Marathon hub.Want to add to this story?Let us know in comments or send an email to the authors at , aabadsantos at theatlantic dot com or matt dot sullivan at theatlantic dot com.You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire.Adam Clark EstesAlexander Abad-SantosMatt Sullivan",

Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.",

Tamerlan was closely monitored while in Dagestan last year.Prosecutors said Matanov had been friends with accused bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spoke with both in the days after the blast but lied to police about the extent of his relationship with the pair.Matanov, who had hiked a New Hampshire mountain with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to \u201ctrain like, and praise, the 'mujahideen,\u201d' according to court papers, deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer, tried to dispose of cell phones he had used to contact the brothers, and denied knowing much about the pair in interviews with police.Matanov was not accused of playing a role in the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. The Tsarnaev brothers have also been accused of shooting dead a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three days after the attack as they tried to flee Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a shootout with police following that incident, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended early the next evening. The surviving brother, now 20, is awaiting trial and faces the possibility of execution if convicted.Matanov told an unidentified witness cooperating with the government that \u201cthe bombings could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam, that he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and that the victims had gone to paradise,\u201d according to the papers.Matanov was arrested early Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at his home in Quincy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of destroying evidence and eight years for each false statement count.He is the fourth person to face criminal charges for interfering with the investigation into the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The others are three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Kazakhstan exchange students Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, as well as Robel Phillipos of Cambridge. Prosecutors contended that after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers, the three men realized the suspects' identities and removed a laptop and backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.",

He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.",

        "context": "Multiple outlets, law enforcement officials, and President Obama responded throughout a manic Monday with news that a horrific looking scene made clear in downtown Boston, even as a frenzied search for more potential explosive devices continued and hospitals rushed to help survivors: The crowd at the finish line of the Boston Marathon was bombed twice in what is being described as both a coordinated \"event\" and \"an act of terror\" with more than 140 people brutally injured at eight Boston hospitals and at least three dead, including a young child.Indeed, even as a city and a nation came together amidst the chaotic scene, there was not much good news in Boston this April 15 \u2014 the annual Patriot Day, a Massachusetts festival holiday with schools and offices closed for the marathon and, on this particular day, tragedy in the happiest of places.The FBI has taken over \"a potential terrorist investigation,\" FBI special agent in charge Richard DesLauriers said at a Monday evening press conference.\"There is no suspect\" at the hospital, Boston Police commissioner Ed Davis said at the briefing, despite reports to the contrary \u2014 and speculation that there was still one or multiple persons of interest being questioned at the hospital.When asked if there was a person of interest at the hospital, DeLaurio declined to comment; he also declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" \u2014 just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(And that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)After the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, Davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as Boston planned to re-open on Tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"Boston police and the FBI were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.At a late afternoon press conference with Patrick, Davis initially reported a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.At a second police briefing, Davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as CNN reported that the FBI had classified the event as a terrorist attack.Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"At a White House briefing shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time on a quiet day in Washington, President Obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.He did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" \u2014 \"America will say a prayer for Boston tonight,\" he said \u2014 before delivering a more forceful message:We don't yet have all the answers ...We still do not know who did this or why...But make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.We will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.NBC News and others reported that the White House said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Tuesday.As the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the Boston police scanner, the Boston Globe live blog, and the local CBS, ABC, and Fox stations \u2014 as well as some solid Twitter lists.The basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.After two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. Boston Police would go on to confirm at least three dead \u2014 NBC News cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the Boston Globe \u2014 and 141 injuries.As for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.ABC News reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.Meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from Copley Square area to makeshift tents, from Boston hospitals to Instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.Scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.You can follow all of The Atlantic Wire's ongoing Boston Marathon bomb coverage right here \u2014 and our Day Two aftermath updates here.The CasualtiesThe Boston Marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.Also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-TIPS.The Boston chapter of the American Red Cross said on Monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.The Red Cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.Reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.In a Monday night press conference, Dr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Mass.General Hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.Fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.Other local hospitals \u2014 some of the best in the nation \u2014 are flooded:Injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: Boston Children\u2019s 8; Brigham 27; BMC 23; MGH 22; BI 21; St E's, 15; Tufts 9 \u2014 The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) April 16, 2013An update at the official law enforcement press conference Monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.CNN reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.The New York Post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a Saudi national\u2014officials have not confirmed this and Boston PD has not confirmed this.CBS News is reporting that Boston PD has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"There are various reports on Twitter of a suspect being detained, but Davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the Post and elsewhere.Among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to The Boston Globe.Of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.The \"Person of Interest\"For now, Boston Police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials \u2014 including the new FBI investigator \u2014 would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.Throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the New York Post about a \"Saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from Fox News.Another report in the Los Angeles Times said one person \u2014 not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a Saudi national \u2014 was being questioned.\"A federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a Saudi national who was taken to a Boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"The person was not identified as a suspect.\"Later on Monday evening The Globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in Marathon bombings at Brigham and Women's Hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.However, the paper maintains, \"The situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"Officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on Monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.The New York Times reports, \"Although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"Meanwhile, the FBI is asking for people to send in any info \u2014 photos, video, tips \u2014 or to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with information regarding the explosions.The investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.Reports of a police search at a Revere, Mass.condo complex between five and six on Monday night lit up Twitter.However, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.The Other DevicesSoon after the initial explosions, Boston Globe photographer David L. Ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and Boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"There were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the AP.A spokeswoman at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while The Boston Globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of Boylston Street.Over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.That number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around Boston and neighboring cities.The Boston Globe reported another device found near Harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the Financial District.There were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as Newton, though local police have denied those claims.Again, the Journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.And then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.Here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout Monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown Boston and beyond \u2014 even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:The FBI said on Monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.Meanwhile, the Navy has sent an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team to help with the effort.The Pictures and Video of the ExplosionHere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:Explosion at coply twitter.com/Boston_to_a_T/\u2026 \u2014 Boston to a T (@Boston_to_a_T) April 15, 2013And one more:Just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s\u2026 \u2014 Chris Chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) April 15, 2013Here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the Globe:Here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of Twitter's Vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):We're going to link to these next two shots (WARNING \u2014 they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to Reddit.NECN's Jackie Bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:I saw people's legs blown off.Horrific.Two explosions.Runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.\u2014 Jackie Bruno (@JackieBrunoNECN) April 15, 2013To be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.Because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (CBS News reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in Boston, and the Secret Service set up a perimeter around the White House) as there are graphic images.There are amputations.Here are some of the first photos to hit the AP wire (WARNING \u2014 it is graphic):This photo from Reuters photographer John Tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:Check out this Tumblr post where you can see Tlumacki taking the photo.And one more from The Boston Globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/GlobeDavidLRya\u2026 \u2014 David L. Ryan (@GlobeDavidLRyan) April 15, 2013Here are more photos from The Atlantic's In Focus blog.Here's video of the first explosion:And another close-up video from the explosion:Here's how a marathon runner saw things:And here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.Here is the photo of Obama on the phone with FBI Director Robert Mueller (official White House photo by Pete Souza):Here is text of President Obama's full remarks at the White House.Adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of Newtown.The Eyewitness AccountsThe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.One of the more powerful ones we've read comes from The New York Times, which spoke to Rhode Island state trooper and former Marine Roupen Bastajian.\"These runners just finished and they don\u2019t have legs now,\" said Bastajian.\"So many of them.There are so many people without legs.It's all blood.There's blood everywhere.You got bones, fragments.It's disgusting.\"Several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.Two worth reading come from The Wall Street Journal reporter Coleen McCain Nelson and Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki.Our own Richard Lawson, a Boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:Marathon Monday is one of Boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.By the time the Boston Marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow Boylston Street, it has entered the busy commercial district of Copley Square.The historic Boston Public Library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of Copley Square Park and the famous Trinity Church.And of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in Boston at any time throughout the year.The crowd on marathon day is dense and varied \u2014 locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.And of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.\u2014Richard LawsonAs the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, Astronaut Chris Hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the International Space Station.\"A somber Spring night in Boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:Closer to home, some folks at MIT paid tribute to the patriotic spirit with an entire building:Stay tuned for the Wire's Day Two live blog and more at our Boston Marathon hub.Want to add to this story?Let us know in comments or send an email to the authors at , aabadsantos at theatlantic dot com or matt dot sullivan at theatlantic dot com.You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire.Adam Clark EstesAlexander Abad-SantosMatt Sullivan",

Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.",

The bag contained altered fireworks the friends threw away.Tazhayakov faces up to 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge and a maximum of five years in jail on the conspiracy charge. His sentencing is scheduled for October 16.Twin bombs exploded near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.Police say that two ethnic Chechen brothers who had lived in the United States for a decade, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried the bombs in backpacks to the Boston street near the finish line before detonating them. Days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gun battle with police and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Authorities say he left a hand-scrawled confession inside the boat that said the bombings were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Muslims in American-led wars overseas.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is in a U.S. prison awaiting trial on multiple charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction.",

        "context": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.",

Tamerlan was closely monitored while in Dagestan last year.Prosecutors said Matanov had been friends with accused bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spoke with both in the days after the blast but lied to police about the extent of his relationship with the pair.Matanov, who had hiked a New Hampshire mountain with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to \u201ctrain like, and praise, the 'mujahideen,\u201d' according to court papers, deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer, tried to dispose of cell phones he had used to contact the brothers, and denied knowing much about the pair in interviews with police.Matanov was not accused of playing a role in the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. The Tsarnaev brothers have also been accused of shooting dead a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three days after the attack as they tried to flee Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a shootout with police following that incident, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended early the next evening. The surviving brother, now 20, is awaiting trial and faces the possibility of execution if convicted.Matanov told an unidentified witness cooperating with the government that \u201cthe bombings could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam, that he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and that the victims had gone to paradise,\u201d according to the papers.Matanov was arrested early Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at his home in Quincy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of destroying evidence and eight years for each false statement count.He is the fourth person to face criminal charges for interfering with the investigation into the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The others are three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Kazakhstan exchange students Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, as well as Robel Phillipos of Cambridge. Prosecutors contended that after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers, the three men realized the suspects' identities and removed a laptop and backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.",

        "context": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.",

        "context": "Boston Bombing Suspect Found GuiltyBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on all counts Wednesday in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings by a federal jury that now must decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be executed.Jurors spent slightly more than 11 hours deciding Tsarnaev's guilt in two days of deliberations after 16 days of testimony.\"It's not something that will ever be over,\" said Karen Brassard, whose ankles and shin were injured by pieces of the bomb. \"You'll feel it forever. It's forever a part of our life. ... I don't know what justice is. I'm grateful to have him off the street.''Two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, killing three people \u2013 Martin Richard, 8, Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29 \u2013 and wounding more than 260 others.Tsarnaev also was convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology patrol officer shot to death three days later, as Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, attempted to evade police.The defendant, dressed in a blue sweater and dark blazer, looked pale as he entered the courtroom to hear the verdict. His lawyer, Judy Clarke, gave him a brief pat on the back as he sat down.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported Tsarnaev folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy, murder and use of a weapon of mass destruction.There were some families of victims in the courtroom, and their reaction as the verdict was read was very calm, Tlisova observed. She noted, though, they seemed satisfied with the verdict, judging by discussions she had with them outside the courthouse.Seventeen of the counts are capital offenses, making Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty.\u201cI hope today\u2019s verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon,\u201d Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said in a statement. \u201cThe incidents of those days have forever left a mark on our city.\u201dJudy Clarke, left, and David Bruck, defense attorneys for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will try to prevent his getting a death sentence. They're shown at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, April 6, 2015.Penalty phaseDuring the penalty phase, which could begin as early as Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life.That could include evidence about his family, his relationship with his brother, and his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile Dagestan region of Russia.Tsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings.But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, defense attorney Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic Chechen who emigrated from Russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Jurors' questionsEarlier Wednesday, the jury asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to clarify two legal terms.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.They asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. O'Toole explained it applied to a plot between Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev that existed from February through April 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.Jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas. The judge said the terms represent a single concept.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947, and Roman Catholic bishops in the state reiterated their opposition to the death penalty on Monday, when the first phase of the trial wrapped up.VOA's Fatima Tlisova contributed to this report from Boston, and some material for this report came from Reuters, AFP and AP.Watch video report from VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this video0:03:18\u25b60:00:00/0:03:18\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.0MB360p | 8.5MB486p | 70.7MB/*<![CDATA[*/initInfographics({groups:[],params:[{\"Name\":\"embed_code\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;div class=\\\"storify\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts/embed?border=false\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"750\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts.js?border=false\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt;[\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u0026gt;View the story \\\"Boston Bomber Convicted on All Counts\\\" on Storify\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;]\\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"String\"}],isMobile:true});Error rendering storify.(function(d){var userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_code\"],notRenderedS = d.querySelectorAll(\".storifySnippet:not(.storifySnippetRendered)\"),render = function() {try {var oEval = d.createElement(\"div\");oEval.innerHTML = userInput;} catch(e) {var snippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastSnippet = snippets[snippets.length - 1];lastSnippet.innerHTML = \"Storify Embed Code is Invalid or Incomplete.\";return;}var oScript = oEval.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]if (oScript && oScript.getAttribute(\"src\").match(/^(https?:)?\\/\\/(www\\.)?storify\\.com\\/([^\\.])+\\.js/gi) !== null) {var lastNotRenderedS = notRenderedS[notRenderedS.length - 1];lastNotRenderedS.innerHTML = \"\";var iframeEle = oEval.getElementsByTagName(\"iframe\")[0];lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(iframeEle);var scriptEle = d.createElement(\"script\");scriptEle.type = \"text\\/javascript\";scriptEle.src = oScript.src;lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(scriptEle);var noscriptEle = oEval.getElementsByTagName(\"noscript\")[0];lastNotRenderedS.appendChild(noscriptEle);lastNotRenderedS.className = lastNotRenderedS.className + \" storifySnippetRendered\";var findAncestor = function (el, cls) {while ((el = el.parentElement) && !el.classList.contains(cls));return el;};var storifySnippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastStorifyS = storifySnippets[storifySnippets.length - 1];var attach = findAncestor(lastStorifyS,\"infgraphicsAttach\");attach.style.width = \"100%\";attach.style.overflow = \"visible\";}};if (d.readyState === \"uninitialized\" || d.readyState === \"loading\")window.addEventListener(\"load\", render);else //liveblog, ajaxrender();})(document);",

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.",

        "context": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==",

        "context": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==",

With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her.

She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family. Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.On Sunday, workers are being told to go to the plant first thing. They\u2019ll be put on buses to the voting centers. Managers are responsible for making sure the workers participate, and have lists saying where each worker votes. They must show up in the company\u2019s uniform too \u2014for the picture.Betania\u2019s dad is determined to vote. He has to protect his job; he\u2019s about to retire, he won\u2019t risk it. His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names.

        "context": "Teaching student jailed over Sweden terror plotThe 20-year-old and his lawyer.Photo: Janerik Henriksson/TTA 20-year-old former teaching student has been locked up for five years for plotting a suicide attack in Sweden.Aydin Sevigin was arrested in February, suspected of having tried to build a bomb.Police found six bottles of aceton, duct tape, a mobile phone and bullets during a search of his home.A receipt for Christmas tree lights and surveillance footage showing him buying a pressure cooker from Ikea were also part of the case.The 20-year-old, who grew up in the well-off suburb Danderyd north of Stockholm, denied the claims, but refused to explain why he bought the ingredients, which can be used to build bombs.\"My opinion is that he acquired, stored and collected liquids and objects to make and then blow up a suicide bomb in order to become a martyr.The criminal act being prepared could seriously have hurt Sweden,\" prosecutor Ewamari H\u00e4ggkvist said ahead of the verdict.Attunda District Court, north of Stockholm, sentenced him to five years in jail on Thursday morning for \"preparing to commit a terror crime\".It said it had reduced the sentence by one year because he is aged under 21.\"It is not clear what would have been the target of a bomb attack.But we believe that blowing up a shrapnel bomb of this kind would have been able to harm Sweden and that the purpose of such a bomb must have been to instil fear in the way referred to by terrorism legislation,\" said the chairman of the court, Mikael Swahn, in a statement.Sevigin's relatives had raised the alarm several months before he was arrested.In June last year one of his family members called the police, saying he was concerned about the 20-year-old, who had then disappeared.He was shortly thereafter stopped in Turkey on two occasions.The first time he was made to return to Greece, the second time he was flown back to Sweden from Istanbul.His intention is believed to have been to travel onwards to Syria to join Isis.Several of his relatives stated during the investigation and trial that the 20-year-old had been experiencing symptoms of depression, isolating himself from others and expressing radical opinions sympathizing with Isis.It was not immediately known if his legal team would attempt to appeal the sentence.The verdict came on the same day as a separate terror trial got under way in Sweden.A 25-year-old man is charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join a militant group.The trial is the first of its kind applying Sweden's new anti-terror laws making it illegal to travel abroad to join terror organizations.",

        "context": "Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.",

Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing.

It's forever a part of our life. ... I don't know what justice is.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic Chechen who emigrated from Russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Jurors' questionsEarlier Wednesday, the jury asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to clarify two legal terms.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.They asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. O'Toole explained it applied to a plot between Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev that existed from February through April 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.Jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas.

        "context": "Questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Friday.Anecdotes suggest that Tamerlan became more religious in the last several years and may have embraced more conservative Islamic ideas, although no link has been established between him and any known terrorist group.On Monday, a spokesman for the Islamic Society of Boston, a Cambridge mosque frequented by Tamerlan, contributed to the emerging debate over the suspect\u2019s religious beliefs by sharing an anecdote from a January talk at the mosque, during which Tamerlan disrupted the event and insulted the speaker, accusing him of deviating from Islam by comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Martin Luther King Jr.It was the second time that Tamerlan disrupted an event at the mosque because he felt that its religious message was too liberal, said the spokesman, Yusufi Vali, according to a report in The Boston Globe.In disrupting the talk in January at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s shouted at a speaker: \u201cYou are a Kafir\u201d \u2014 a nonbeliever, according to Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque.Tsarnaev went on to say the speaker was contaminating people\u2019s minds and accused him of being a hypocrite.The congregation disagreed, according to Vali, and \u201cshouted him out of the mosque\u201d on Prospect Street.Tsarnaev also interrupted a talk last November when a speaker said it was fine for people to celebrate holidays such as Thanksgiving and July 4, in the same way you celebrate the birthday of the Prophet.Tsarnaev challenged him and the two talked after service.\u201cThe brother was angry, but he left,\u2019\u2019 Vali said.The Islamic Society of Boston issued a news release on Monday afternoon detailing the organization\u2019s interactions with the suspects, who it said were \u201cneither members nor regular attendees\u201d of religious services there.The statement focused almost exclusively on Tamerlan, who the organization said had begun coming \u201cintermittently\u201d to weekly Friday Prayers and \u201coccasionally\u201d to daily services about a year ago.It said Dzhokhar \u201cwas rarely seen at the center, coming only occasionally for prayer.\u201dThe statement included lengthy descriptions of the incidents in January and November when Tamerlan disrupted events at the mosque, leading the community there to reprimand and ostracize him.On November 16, 2012, at our weekly congregational prayer, one of our preachers sermonized that it was appropriate to celebrate national holidays like July 4th and Thanksgiving, just like the birthday of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).The older suspect stood up during the sermon and challenged the preacher, arguing that celebration of any holiday was not allowed in the faith.After the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.The suspect repeatedly argued his viewpoint, and then left.On January 18, 2013, one of our preachers noted that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great person remembered in history.The older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a \u201cnonbeliever\u201d; said that he was \u201ccontaminating people\u2019s minds\u201d; and began calling him a hypocrite.People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, \u201cLeave now!\u201d Due to the congregation\u2019s disapproval, he left the sermon.After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.The statement said that no member of the mosque\u2019s board or staff \u201cever interacted\u201d with either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan, who it said \u201cdisagreed with the moderate American-Islamic theology of the I.S.B.Cambridge mosque.\u201d\u201cOur mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWhile these suspects did express views counter to our mosque\u2019s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.If they had, the F.B.I.would have immediately been called.\u201dOn Saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to Twitter by several people, including Steve Annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to Boston Magazine.Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.They were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1ZWxagi \u2014 Steve Annear (@steveannear) 21 Apr 13The note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the Boston Marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the F.B.I.with any information they may have about the Tsarnaev brothers.The statement was also posted on the mosque\u2019s Web site.",

The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the streetPolice officer at the sceneFrom the outset, the IRA's bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit.Such was the scale of the attack, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being detonated.As one report at the time described the scene, \"it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe\".Car bombsWhile the scale of the attack was huge, it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast.At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed.When the emergency services reached the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11.At the Cavehill Road bomb, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy.Of the 130 injured, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.\"You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,\" he told the series.Collapsed ceasefireIn terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster.Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities.It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time.Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofainBy June, the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed.Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible.But after causing the deaths, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings.Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge.Within 10 days of the attacks, the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides.DenialsIn later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility.\"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,\" he said.\"Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.\"Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972. It remains the bloodiest year of the conflict in Northern Ireland.By the end of 1972, 496 had been killed, 258 of them civilians.",

Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA. ==Background== The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene. Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro. In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident. Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable. The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing.

The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene. Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro. In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident. Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo.

S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self-radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network. The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys.
